| Client changes requirements                              | The client can unexpectedly change the requirements or add new ones, which could cause possible delays if the work was already done.                                       | Risk       | Very High | To avoid this issue, regular questions are asked to the client to ensure that the current work is satisfactory. The client also informed the team of any changes by Slack as soon as possible.             |
| Absences                                                 | Team members may have personal issues or can be sick and so on provoking absences, which could slow down the rhythm of the project and the work of the other team members. | Risk       | High      | Provide early notification of an absence so that work can be redistributed to other team members. If the absence is unpredictable, the absent member must do their best to make up for the missed work.    |
| Lack of communication between team members               | Communication is essential in a project. If the communication is not optimal, it can lead to misunderstandings, delays, and errors.                                        | Risk       | High      | Use Slack to communicate and share information.

| Break a feature with another one                         | When a feature is added, it can break another one.                                                                                                                         | Risk       | High      | Test the software and make sure that the features are working correctly. Also, make sure that the team is aware of the changes. Finally, create sub-branches before implement features into the dev branch |
| Technical issues                                         | Technical issues can occur during the project, such as a computer crash, a loss of data, or a bug in the code.                                                             | Risk       | High      | Regularly save the work and use GitHub.

| Lack of motivation                                       | The lack of motivation can lead to a lack of productivity and a lack of interest in the project.                                                                           | Assumption | Medium    | Regularly check the motivation of the team members and make sure that everyone is satisfied with their tasks.                                                                                              |
| Team member(s) do(es) not have the skill for the project | Skill issues in a particular field can lead to errors, misunderstandings, and delays.                                                                                      | Assumption | Medium    | Provide training to the team members in the areas where they lack experience.
