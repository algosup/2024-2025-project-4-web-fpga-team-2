# Post Mortem - Team 2

## Overview

A post mortem is a document that summarizes how a project went, what its strengths and weaknesses were, and what can be improved for future projects. Basically, it is a retrospective of the project. It is important to note that this document is not meant to be a blame game, but rather a constructive analysis of the project. The goal is to learn from the experience of all members to improve ourselves as well as projects in the future.
