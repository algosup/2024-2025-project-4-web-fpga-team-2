# Weekly Report 6 - Team 2: "Web FPGA"

# 6th week: 03/31/25 - 04/04/25

## Overview

### Documents

All the documents are finished and are now in the main branch. The only thing that is missing is the Post Mortem file, which is not finished yet. The Post Mortem file will be finished by Friday, March 25th.

### Website

The website is now finished. The final touches have been made to the circuit visualizer and the interface. We can consider that the website is ready for the oral presentation. All the optional features (such as the toolbar and the different option to share the circuit) aren't implemented in order to focus on the schemas (circuit visualizer) and the interface.

## Management Planing

### KPIs

Like the previous week, all the KPIs are now stored in a Google Sheet. The KPIs' table can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IzNeeq6BHiJQUQX-DqInGMWjPvM-9AiJ3GWgXlKIHhs/edit?usp=sharing).

### Management Documents

All the management documents have been written, except for the Post-Mortem file, which is still missing because it has not been completed yet. It will be finalized by Friday, March 25th.
