# Weekly Report 3 - Team 2: "Web FPGA"

# 3rd Week: 04/10/25 - 04/14/25

## Overview

### Documents

The functional specification is now finished by the Program Manager. It was reviewed by the technical as well as the Project Manager and the Quality Assurance. The technical specification can now begin to be written in its entirety (since Friday 14th). The QA also finished his test plan and started to write the test cases.

### Website

The developers successfully finished to implement the parser. The JSON can now be used to automatically create the schematics. The circuit visualizer (grouping "Connecting wire between components" and "Schematics realized by the JSON file" tasks) is now 80% complete. However, the POC is finished which is a big step forward; we can now focus on the additional features. The user interface of the dashboard is also 75% finish.

## Management Planing

### KPIs

### Management Documents

The Risk Management Plan is now finished. The Management Artifacts document has been created and almost finished. The KPIs will be store in a Google Sheet for a better readability from the next week.

### Problems Encountered

Unfortunately, due to a misunderstanding the QA thought that the deadline for the functional specification was on the 14th causing a little delay in reviewing of the document. However, the document and its review were commit before the deadline (Thursday 13rd).

## Next Week

- Finish the Technical Specification for 75%.
- Finish the circuit visualizer.
- Try to finish the dashboard (the UI is less important for now than the circuit visualizer).
- Find new ideas for the Test Cases.
- Finish the Management Artifacts document.
- Start the KPIs' Google Sheet.
