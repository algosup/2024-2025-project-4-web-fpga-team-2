# Weekly Report 4 - Team 2: "Web FPGA"

# 4th week: 04/17/25 - 04/21/25

## Overview

### Documents

The technical specification continue to be written and is now at 30%. The QA wrote also other test cases to test more efficiently the code and the website behavior (35%). Finally, 2 questions were asked to the customer to know if what we are currently doing convinced him and to have more informations about the schemas.

### Website

The circuit visualizer improved by the addition of the possibility to animate the schematic (70% complete). Also, the teacher can now display his circuit to his student (a connection between him and his student was established). 

## Management Planing

### KPIs

All the KPIs are now stored in a Google Sheet. The KPIs' table can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IzNeeq6BHiJQUQX-DqInGMWjPvM-9AiJ3GWgXlKIHhs/edit?usp=sharing).
