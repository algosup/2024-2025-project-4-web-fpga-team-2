# Weekly Report 5 - Team 2: "Web FPGA"

# 5th week: 03/24/25 - 03/28/25

## Overview

### Documents

The technical specification is from now on 100% complete. The QA almost finish his test cases (90%) and the Technical Leader also wrote in this almost entirety the README for the repository (95%). The customer also answered to the questions we asked him last week and we are now more enlightened on certain aspects of the code (such as the Input with a Constant 0 value).

### Website

Some upgrades have been made to the circuit visualizer. Basically, before, the "real" names were displayed on the schemas, so as they were indicated in the uploaded files (more often, humanly unreadable because they are too long and meaningless). <br>
Now, with the last update, the names have been shorted to be more readable and to understand more their utility. We can consider the visualizer as 85% complete for now.

## Management Planing

### KPIs

Like the previous week, all the KPIs are now stored in a Google Sheet. The KPIs' table can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IzNeeq6BHiJQUQX-DqInGMWjPvM-9AiJ3GWgXlKIHhs/edit?usp=sharing).

### Management Documents

The Management Artifacts document is now finished (all the missing links were added). Also, the Gantt Chart of the project (including the general and the code one) is now finished and is saved as a svg document.

## Next Week

- Finish entirely the Test Cases and continue to test the website.
- Finish the README and put it in the main branch.
- Finish the latest features of the website (all the Interface, as well as the visualizer).
