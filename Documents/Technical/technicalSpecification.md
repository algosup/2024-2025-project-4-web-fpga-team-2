## Introduction
The project consists of creating a webpage that simulates the behavior of an FPGA and generates, from a .v and .sdf file, a blueprint of the FPGA with its components and the connections between them. It is intended to be used to teach people how signals propagate inside an FPGA.

## Objectives

- Simulate an FPGA and generate a blueprint of its components and their connections.

- Provide a user-friendly interface.

- Load a .v and .sdf file.

- Download or share the blueprint as a .png file.

- The teacher will access the webpage, use this functionality, and share it with students to explain how an FPGA works.

- Students will view the webpage while the teacher explains and simulates the FPGA's behavior.

## Conventions

There are conventions to follow during the project.
You can check them using this link:
[Convention](https://github.com/algosup/2024-2025-project-4-web-fpga-team-2/blob/main/Documents/Technical/convention.md)

## Requirements

To see all Requirements it is recommended to read the [functional specification](https://github.com/algosup/2024-2025-project-4-web-fpga-team-2/blob/main/Documents/Functional/functionalSpecification.md) document.

## System Architecture
### A. Overview

| Input | Processing | Output |
| ----- | ---------- | ------ |
|A .v file or .sdf file.|Read the file.|Display a blueprint of FPGA components and their connections on the web page.|



## Frontend

The front end of the website will be made using HyperText Markup Language (HTML)[^html], Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)[^css] , and JavaScript (JS)[^js] .

HTML is used to build the structure of the website , which can then be interpreted by any browser on any hardware to display the website.<br>
We then use CSS to modify the appearance of the website, making it more visually appealing, which results in a more attractive website and a better user experience. <br>
Finally, JS is used to handle events and modify the webpage directly from the browser, such as load a file.
