<summary>1.Introduction</summary>

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Document Purpose

This document shows the **Quality Assurance activities** to provide **clarity** on the approach taken, the **produced results** and the **conclusions reached** out of this project.


It also demonstrates our **documentation reviewing** and indicates our **testing procedure**, including:

- ***The testing strategy***
  - It outlines **the goals** of the test plan, describes the **testing field**, the **testing environment**, and the **test plan scope** and categorizes the **types of testing** involved. 
- ***The execution strategy***
  - Describe how **tests will be performed**, and the process for any kind of issue or bug encountered during the project period.
- ***The test management***
  - It outlines the procedure for **managing the test logistics** and addressing all events that arise during execution.

### 1.2 Project Purpose

This project has for purpose to help [FPGA](#glossary) teacher making students understand the basics of FPGA hardware system by using schemas.

### 1.3 Customers

Our customer is a FPGA teacher at CNES, the equivalent of NASA in France. He wants to be able to teach more easily to his students the basis of FPGA hardware.

<summary>2. Documentation Reviewing</summary>

## 2. Documentation Reviewing

### 2.1 Document Criteria

The majority of our documents have **the same criteria**, making harmony between them is required for **standardization and a better organization of the project**.

The common criteria are:
- All documents must have a **table of contents** for better navigation.
- Documents must stay **as simple as possible**, making them **short and not too technical**. If technical terms are necessary to implement, a **glossary must be implemented**.
- All the documents are written in **English**.

Files and folder naming criteria's can be found in the [conventions document](/Documents/Technical/convention.md).

### 2.2 Review Process

To review the documents, we use **GitHub issues** to track any problems like typos or criteria that haven't been addressed.

A GitHub issue template will be initiated.

<summary>3.Testing Strategy</summary>

## 3. Testing Strategy

### 3.1 Tests' Main Goal

The main goal behind doing tests is to **ensure that all project criteria's are checked**, and possibly enhance the quality of the project for a better user experience.

### 3.2 Testing Field

#### Web Platforms

Our project must work at least on Chromium since this platform is the most common web platform.

Other platforms will be tested only if Chromium version has been validated.

#### Software Used

For this project we are using multiple softwares :

- For the program:
  - HTML
  - JavaScript and JSON
  - CSS
  - TypeScript
  - React

*More information on the [Technical Specification](/Documents/Technical/technicalSpecification.md)*

- For Testing :
  - Python

### 3.3 Testing Environment
For testing we are using 3 MAC's and 1 Windows computer to ensure the compatibility between the two platforms.


### 3.4 Test Scope

**In scope**
  
- Chromium testing.
- Schema analysis.
- Time calculation.
- Teacher side features.

**Out of Scope**

- Mobile connectivity.
- Other web platform testing.
- Student side features

### 3.5 Testing Types

There are different types of testing :

**Functional testing**

Functional testing is a type of software testing that evaluates the functionality of the program based on specified requirements that have been written in the [Functional Specification](/Documents/Functional/functionalSpecification.md). The program needs to perform as expected, focusing on user-facing features and behaviors. This type of testing includes integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing.

**Unit testing**

Unit testing is a type of software testing where we test a small and precise part of the program to see if it works properly.

### 3.6 Pull Request Strategy

To ensure pull request (or PR) correctness and without errors, we placed securities on the main branch using GitHub rules system. 

To validate a PR for the main branch it needs to be **verified by the quality assurance** except quality assurance's PR that has to be **verified by the technical leader**.

<summary>4.Execution Strategy</summary>

## 4. Execution Strategy

### 4.1 Testing Criteria

To ensure that our test goes as smoothly as possible, we have some testing criteria that we have to fulfill in every test:

- Are tested features in line with the specifications defined in the documents?
<br>
- Does the feature work as intended by the developer?
<br>
- Is this feature easy to use for the user?



### 4.2 GitHub Issues

GitHub's issues are created to track any problems in the program or the documents as mentioned in "[**2. Document reviewing**](#2-documentation-reviewing)".

However, compared to documents GitHub issues, tests GitHub issues will be based on the corresponding **test cases**.

### 4.3 GitHub Issue Templates

GitHub allows creation of numerous templates for any kind of issues.

For this project we have templates for :
- Program's bug tracking
- Test cases
- Non code related issues

This allows a better precision to resolves assignations issues and add clarity in the testing field.

### 4.4 Test Cases

Test cases are specifications of the execution condition, testing procedure, and expected results that define a single test to be executed to achieve a particular software testing objective.

We also use a system of **labels** to identify the severity of the test cases:

- High
- Medium
- Low

### 4.5 Bug Tracking Schema

*Bug tracking schema*

### 4.6 Python Testing

Some tests are being automated with [Python](#glossary) programs. For example, we have a program that analyze given FPGA programs and create a schema of used systems in it. Allowing us to verify if our program shows a correct schema.

![image](/Documents/TestPlan/Image/pythonProgram.png)

*Example of a schema made with a python program*

### 4.7 Manual Testing

Because it's a web page, most of the test has to be done manually, testing all features related to non calculation aspect of this project.

For example, we have to test if we can upload files.

<summary>5. Test Management</summary>

## 5. Test Management

### 5.1 Tools

To manage our test we are using specific tools :

- We use GitHub for test management. Test cases and GitHub issues are updated in the [GitHub Issue section](https://GitHub.com/algosup/2024-2025-project-4-web-fpga-team-2/issues).
<br>
- We have Python scripts to enhance testing properly.
<br>
- An [excel table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1K0NGR9Gy0eXgPXVqPabkYytwUibx3F4-xqDcYCp--LI/edit?usp=sharing) stocking the progress of each test cases.

### 5.2 Test Design

We have a conforming plan of how we create and process our tests.

![image](/Documents/TestPlan/Image/testDesignSchema.png)

*Test design schema*

### 5.3 Test Deliverables

- **Test Plan:** It documents our approach and methodology for testing, explaining how tests will be managed and performed.
  
- **Test Cases:** It represents a set of tests created to ensure that our application works as intended.
  
- **Test Scripts:** Programs that help enhance some tests in terms of efficiency and speed.

- **GitHub's issue:** This section documents any identified issues encountered during the testing phase.
