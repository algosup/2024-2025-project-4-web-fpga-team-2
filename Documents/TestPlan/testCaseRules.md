# Test case rules

This document has been created to explain the test case rules.

## 1 : All Test cases must have an ID

Test cases need an ID to find the wanted test case swiftly and categorize them.

## 2 : Deeper details and explanations are required

The specific test has to be as much precise as possible for an exact understanding of this test.

## 3 : There must be regular test cycle

A cycle of test must be done regularly to ensure progression of the project gradually.

## 4 : Test cases must relate to the product

Test cases aren't for documentations and non code related issues.

## 5 : Expected Results Must Be Defined

Each test case should include the expected result, making it easy to verify if the test passed or failed.

## 6 : Test Data Should Be Defined

Any required test data should be specified, including valid inputs, boundary conditions, and edge cases, to ensure the test case is properly executed.

## 7 : Priority and Severity

Test cases should be classified with priority (low, medium, high) to identify their importance and impact on the system.

## 8 : Test Case Maintenance

Test cases should be reviewed and updated regularly to reflect any changes in the project, such as feature changes, bug fixes, or refactoring.

## 9 : Handling of Negative Scenarios

Test cases should include scenarios that validate error handling and edge cases, testing how the system behaves under unexpected or incorrect inputs.
