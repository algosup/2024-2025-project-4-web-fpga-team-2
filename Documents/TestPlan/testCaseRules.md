Test cases need an ID to find the wanted test case swiftly and categorize them.

## 2 : Deeper Details and Explanations are Required

The specific tests has to be as much precise as possible for an exact understanding of this test.

## 3 : There Must Be a Regular Test Cycle

A cycle of test must be done regularly to ensure progression of the project gradually.

## 4 : Test Cases Must Relate to The Product

Test cases aren't for documentation and non-code-related issues.

## 5 : Expected Results Must Be Defined

Each test case should include the expected result, making it easy to verify if the test passed or failed.

## 6 : Test Data Should Be Defined

Any required test data should be specified, including valid inputs, boundary conditions, and edge cases, to ensure the test case is properly executed.

## 7 : Priority and Severity

Test cases should be classified with priority (low, medium, high) to identify their importance and impact on the system.

## 8 : Test Case Maintenance

Test cases should be reviewed and updated regularly to reflect any changes in the project, such as feature changes, bug fixes, or refactoring.

## 9 : Handling of Negative Scenarios

Test cases should include scenarios that validate error handling and edge cases, testing how the system behaves under unexpected or incorrect inputs.
